## What is an agency relationship

A common example is a real estate agent, which is a person that is responsible for assisting the principal buy or sell their home. An agent has the responsibility to ethically perform the task at hand to the best intentions of the principal. The principal has the responsibility to give the agent legal instructions and honor the terms of the agent being their proxy.

For example they cannot ask the agent to burn down their house when it cannot be sold. Nor can they have multiple agents if the terms state the business relationship is exclusive.

In parallel the agent cannot extend their authority beyond the stated agreed upon point. Consider if the house needs to be sold for 100,000. The realitor can accept offers for 100k or more but would not be permitted to accept an offer for 80k.

If an offer was made for less then the agent would need to return to the principal and get approval before continuing with the potential sale.

## Responsiblity to Third Party

> You authorized Gina Generous to sell the old taxis through newspaper ads for a "reasonable price."  You have just learned that despite a Blue Book Value of $7,500 each, Gina has tentatively sold the first two taxis for $3,000 each and promised to give one as a donation to Father Bill's local charity.  Do you have any recourse?

The difference between the articles scenario and the car's scenario, is that the article describes a failure to deliver on a business promise. If one says they will perform a task then they need to perform that task. Otherwise it's breach of contract and a no one will look favorably at the situation.

In contract Gina took something and gave it away without the authority to do so. This would make the use case more similar to a theft or negligence at a minimum. Additionally,  last week's lessons on property discussed how the taxi owner should be able to retrieve his lost property as it was not handled as instructed by an agent.

Though for an old 7500$ car it might be more advantageous to let the donation go through and claim the tax write off. Fighting the case and collecting from Father Bill would likely be more hassle than the owner wishes to endure.

Having agents increases the number of business transactions and is therefore good for the economy. In order to encourage this model protections must exist for the principal.

In this example the agent extended their authority and did not perform their task responsibility or with the principals best intentions. This can be grounds for a tort suit, where the taxi owner sues for damages from Gina.

An argument could be made that the reasonable price was not defined, and getting some amount of money is in fact reasonable. However this would be a difficult to sell as the 6k on 22.5k is roughly 25% fair market value. Now if she had gotten 65% or higher then it would be easier to convince the judge that the conditions were fair. 

The principal could also sue for the cars to be returned as Gina did not have the authority to make the transaction. However in this scenario suing for the property returned could be difficult and expensive. 

## Contractors versus Employees

Around ten years ago my employer was sued by the short term staff for benefits pay. They argued that they worked as hard as the long term staff and needed desired the same rights and privileges. The legal team discussed this and came back with a new policy that all short term staff is required to take a 90 day unpaid vacation every year.

By taking 90 days off unpaid it reduces the average hours worked per year to below 35, thus making them part time contractors. Contractors do not expect to get any additional benefits only what is agreed upon in the contract. While this solved the employers issues it created a new set of issues for the contractors. Most of them do not renew more than once or twice as taking an entire season off is difficult. 

In principal I do not think that it is fair to punish the contractors, but from a business management perspective understand the rational. If there was not a method to reduce the costs of the contractors they would not have as much money to spend on the long term staff. 

## Is age discrimination acceptable behavior

No, The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 specifically forbids this behavior.

Even if that was not the case, I disagree with the point that employers prefer younger employees. In the previous course, Human Resources, we went into depth on this point and concluded that older employees tend to be more professional and more emotionally intelligent.

If an employee is more professional and also understands how to treat people respectfully, they can accomplish a lot for the business. Older people also come with more seniority and experience, which enables them to navigate complex practices as they have done it before and learned from the mistakes.

## Do employees have a right to privacy on employer owned equipment

> The courts recently decleared that employees are not protected by the 4th amendment, when an employer wants to examine the state of computer equipment owned by the business. Do you agree? Moore, P. J., Doherty, T. F., Collins, P. M., Brenia, R., & Hubbard, T. R. (2011). Recent  developments in employment law. Tort Trial & Insurance Practice Law Journal,46(2), 317-330. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/875100140?accountid=458

With regards toward "Employment-related privacy issues"; I am of the opinion that if the device is owned by the business it is their property and they should be free to do with it as they see fit. If it is the employees property, e.g. smart phone, then it the employee has full control over what happens on that device or whom it is shared with.

Where this logic gets fuzzy is the bring your own device (BYOD) movement, which is an increasingly common trend. Under a BYOD plan the business will typically ask the employee to choose their own laptop that they will do their work on. The device may or may not be reimbursed.

To work around the fuzziness many enterprises are moving from issuing control policy to issuing governance policy. For example the business might say "you can put your email on a device" provided (1) the disk is encrypted (2) has latest security updates and (3) the mail program supports remote wipe.

This gives the employee the flexibility to "opt-in" to the aspects which they feel comfortable. Meanwhile the business only enables scenarios that they agree to the specific terms.

## Diversity in the Workplace

Having a diverse workforce expands the options available to the team, but providing more a wider variety of skills. For example if the group is only old men they are less likely to think about women's issues or common youth concepts such as social media. 

Customer's also prefer to work with diverse companies as its more likely there will be someone that understands them. For instance in the video there was a staff member who spoke Arabic and was able to translate documents for their primarily Arabic customers. These personalized touches help with customer retention and reduce frustration on their end.

Diversity in the workplace can cause challenges, for instance if two people have vastly different cultures they might not get along. This can result in a lot of head butting and unneeded tension as ideas are shared. To mitigate these concerns the leadership needs to identify these issues early on and put a stop to them before they get out of hand.

## Ethical Dilemmas with Co-Workers

The first story describes a woman who is cheating her company in order to made friends. That does not make sense, they are using her and do not care about her. In return she should not care what they think. If she continues doing these unethical actions it will only be a matter of time before she is fired. When she is fired it is unlikely that those same people will continue to think she is cool.

The second story describes an incompetent employee that needs to find another position. If her supervisor gives a good review for a bad employee it will hurt their credibility. Once our credibility is damaged it can takes months or years to recover from that professionally. This is largely why I never vouch or refer other people for employment.

In either scenario the right choice is to be ethical and do the right thing, that's what the employer is paying them to do. Assume that every action is publicly documented for the world to know and ask yourself if it would be embarrassing for the whole world to know. If so then do not do it.
