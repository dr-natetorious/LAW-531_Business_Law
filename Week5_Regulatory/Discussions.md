## Duties of corporate director

A corporate directory is responsible for planning, organizing, and then delivering on the best possible solutions for the business. If they fail to deliver due diligence on a decision then they are liable for the damages to the business.

Consider the scenario where a director recommends and then gets the business to purchase a competitor for 20m. If that business turns out to be only worth 5m and he didn't even look at their books to discover this, he will likely be fired. If the organization is a public company then she also runs a high risk of also being sued by the shareholders for the avoidable loss (aka gross negligence). 

To quote spiderman, with great power comes great responsibility. These rules and conditions rightfully exist as directors and other executive leadership has the ability to completely destroy the business. Their failures can cost investors millions of dollars and thousands of people their livelihood. 

The book made the point that "if an ordenary prudent person in the same profession" would not have made the same choice, then it is likely a scenario of negligent behavior. In being negligent the director would have caused damages to the business thus violating their duty of care.

To mitigate these sorts of issues, a person with authority needs to make sure they understand all the facts. The facts also need to be properly vetted for accuracy. Only with the full picture can they rationally proceed. 

The rules are very harsh for directors and executives, but employees at all levels of the organization should follow this model.

### Should it be illegal for directors to buy/flip smaller businesses

I would disagree, the executives that are buying and flipping, have a responsibility to their shareholders to continue increasing profits. If they do not the investors will seek damages or vote the leadership out.

Now that is not to say that people should commit crimes or act unethically. For example if they sent over thugs and threated the owner to sell, that would criminal and wrong.

For the businesses that are discounted they have an opportunity to make money in the transaction. For example they could retain the rights to continue using their intellectual property. An example of this happened recently with Nokia and Microsoft.

## Liability of Professionals

> Greg, Kim, Phil, and Bob each own 20 percent of the shares of a company and serve as the board of directors of the company, Home Health, Inc. George is also a 20 percent shareholder, but he is not a member of the board of directors. When Bob dies, his wife Suzie inherits his shares of stock that were then worth $100,000, and replaces him on the board. Unfortunately, she is so grief-stricken that she is completely inattentive to corporate affairs. During this period, Greg, Kim, and Phil extend loans to themselves totaling $250,000 from corporate funds that they never pay back. When George discovers that Home Health, Inc. is insolvent, he sues Suzie for breach of her duty of care to the corporation. Discuss Suzie's liability. May Suzie assert the limited liability of the corporate form as a defense?

There would be multiple things legally wrong with this scenario. First Greg, Kim and Phil are not allowed to treat the business as if it is their private piggy bank. This would be in violation of the SOX act among other regulatory legislation. 

Next Suzie does not have the capcity to lead the organization and would need to be replaced, as soon as it became appearant she did not have the companies best interests. The other active members of the board are liable as were both tasked with ensuring the companies existence and had the capacity to do so.

However Suzie was not removed and continued to lead the business, which makes her liable. If she did not feel confident with this position, she needed to decline the role. Because she failed to do this George is out his 20% and all the employees are out of work. 

George should also sue the other members of the board as they are equally if not more so responsible for allowing this behavior to continue.

### What would be the impact of professionals not held to higher standard

If professionals were not held up to certain standards, there would chaos in the open market. For example a person with no experience or training could start doing income tax returns. If that tax return is wrong who should be blamed?

It would not be fair to come after the person who requested the service. When they seeked out the professional that became and acknowledged they lacked this skill. They put trust in this professional who said they had the required training to perform the work. 

The person misrepresented the facts and had no business enlisting in that work. This must make their liable as they are solely to blame. If they had been forthright the principal would have selected a different accountant, avoiding the entire scenario.

## Beyond Compliance to Profit with Prinicpals

To summarize both this course and the video; business needs to be fair, ethical, and not cheat.

Businesses that do unfair things damage the ecosystem, are liable for damages, and eventually will need to pay for those infractions. There is legislation, such as the SOX Act which will not only sue for damages but also raise criminal charges against executive leadership that violates the trust of the public.

This is required otherwise the common people would stop investing in public companies, and the current economic design would fall apart. For example this weeks material discussed how directors are held to a higher standard than managers. I agree with that line of thought as well, as people with "great power" need to have "great responsibility."

Going back to the first course of this series, the higher up in the leadership a person is the more their focus controls the business. These people need to be highly accountable or they will introduce damages to thousands of investors and employees. It is their fiduciary duty to do the right thing always.

For some scenarios that might mean they lose a bit of potential revenue. However after taking into account the bad public relations, legal fees, and looking at the big picture we really are talking about peanuts.

## What is the impact from inconsistent regulation

Anytime that there is inconsistent regulation, it will cause problems for the business. These challenges will come in the form of increased complexity and costs. There is also a high risk that mistakes will be made resulting in fines and negative media reports. 

To mitigate these issues the business needs to work with law makers and push for better new rules which provide a single set of rules for everyone. For small businesses this can be difficult as they lack the capital and resources to be involved in these discussions.

Small businesses can still get their voice heard by joining coalitions, working groups, or signing petitions. All of these efforts requires small investments and gives power to the collective voice for change.

## What is the Prinicipal Agent Problem

When we buy stocks or other securities, how do we know that the investment will use our money legally and ethically? It is not sufficient to say that the security is a blue chip, as there are lots of examples of these being corrupt. 

By having these concerns it reduces investor confidence in the market. As confidence decreases so does the value of all securities in that market. The rotten apple has spoiled the barrel so to speak. 

There needs to be reasonable protection through legislation such as SOX, but we do not want to go overboard with too many rules. The video quotes a swag estimate that its only 2% that are criminal. We do not want to penalize the other 98% which are already operating ethically.

A good compromise would be to create systems that allow for transparent and standardized auditing of the organization. Then monitoring and alerting can be deployed to catch irregularities. Using targeted investigations the government can be more value for their time and not hurt the system by being overly involved.

## Should corporate options discounted from shareholder value

One of the interesting points of this video was the discussion around corporate options. These are rights to buy a stock for a given price, where that right extends for a duration of time. The debate around these options is if the executives should get so many of them and if they need to be counted as an expense.

For example the option might be 50$ per share and have a expiration of 10 years. Which if the prices goes up to 75$ per share the executive can 'call' the contract and profit 25$ per share. When they do this the 50$ loan is returns back to the company and the 25$ came from the open market.

However if the price dropped to 25$ then the option is never exercised; thus the loan is never taken and there is no expense occurring. An argument can be made that the business lost opportunity, as those shares were reserved for a period of time. They could have been sold to the open market.

The problem with this view is that it does not properly reflect how the derivatives market work. Those shares would have been sold either way and in the event they were called the contract holder would be required to present them at that time.
