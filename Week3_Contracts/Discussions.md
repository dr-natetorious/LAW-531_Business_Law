## Android Patents

A patent is a copyright on a design or idea and makes it individually owned. If another entity would like to use that design then they need to pay royalties to the patent owner. Because the royalties can only be given out by a single vendor this makes protecting the patent a potentially lucrative asset.

For example Google goes through the hassle of designing, marketing, and producing their Android phones. At the end of their hard work, Microsoft comes in and collects a 4.5 billion check for owning thousands of mobile device patents. Then Blackberry and IBM come in right after and get their piece of the pie. In the end Google is the only one that doesn't make money on Android devices. 

When Google doesn't lease a patent for their upcoming feature then they are sued by the holder. These suits make the head lines as other companies like Sony demand back payment often to the tune of billions of dollars. 

For large businesses they're stock price will drop due to the news, for smaller companies they can wiped out as they drown in legal fees.

## Message expanded.Message readWriting Requirements for Intra-company Actions

My job takes place at a large corporation (130k employees), where we often have to rely on a different division to provide a service. For example our team uses a document backup program written and controlled by a completely separate team.

When we started using the backup service my manager was very insistent that we get in witting what they supported. It didn't make a lot of sense to me until reading this chapter. From my perspective it did not make a lot of sense and seemed to be a hassle; after all we're within the same company.

However the backup program will probably be there longer than our current point of contact, myself, or my manager. What about the next person on our team that needs to manage that process? Or what happens when it breaks 18 months down the road and there is a debate on the priority of fixing it?

At these critical points having the ability to retrieve a mail thread could argument.

## What constitutes performance or lack of performance of a contract

Performance refers to the quality of the results delivered by the contracted party. For example if Alice hires Bob to paint her house, later paint has been applied to the house and Bob has filled the requirement of the contract.

However he might have only painted most of the house or not performed due diligence, which resulted in poor workmanship. Now he has completed the requirement of the contract but not the intention of the contract.

To mitigate these scenarios buyers and sellers have the ability to specify quality expectations of the result. Then conditional clause can be attached to the contract so that reprimands can be made to cover damages.

## What is civil foreiture

Found a YouTube video where Jon Oliver discusses a similar topic called "Civil Forfeiture." These are a collection of laws which allow law enforcement to seize property if they believe it will be used as part of a crime. He reports that 2.5 billion dollars in cash alone have been seized across 6100 cases. 

It seems that their original purpose was to assist the war on terrorist and drugs. The challenge with these laws is that the property becomes the item under arrest, and the owner is forced to prove the item was innocent before it can be returned.

According to testimonies there is little oversight to how the money can be spent afterward. With the ability to arbitrarily take funds and little oversight, corruption cannot be far behind. For example one police station bought a Margaretta machine for the break room. 

This sounds like a constitutional violation as it deprives one of their property, and perhaps Oliver is embellishing for comedic purposes. Though it seems there are dozens of news reports on the matter including articles from the ACLU. Given the ACLU's credibility the problem is likely genuine.

## Types of Personal Property

There are two categories of property, personal and real. Real is defined as anything that is attached to the Earth and personal everything else. For example personal property would include a cell phone, table, pet, chair, or car. Real property would include a building, parking lot, or barn.

Businesses can be come involved in a bailment when they become responsible for a customers property. This might occur while delivering a package, a coat check, or running a storage locker. The business can also be involved from the other direction such as renting equipment. 

When the business has been entrusted with a customers property they need to preform due diligence. If they do not then the business can be liable for damages. There are scenarios where the property can be damaged and the business is not liable. For instance, if the warehouse containing the property is destroyed by act of god or public enemy.

## Creative Common Licenses

A place where creative common licenses appear is in open source software (OSS). OSS are programs which are shipped with the code and the person with the code is free to use it for certain purposes.

For example some OSS licenses permit anyone to use the code provided they do not make money. Others are more flexible and only ask that credit be given to them or royalties if the business makes over X$ revenue.

Since the creative licenses for OSS range from free to needing to pay; it is important for companies to read and understand the terms. If they do not then they could accidentally violate the licensing terms and end up with a hefty fine.

## CyberEthics

One of the challenges of electronic communication is that it dehumanizes the other end of the conversation. By default we do not think "I'm talking to Jane" we think its user 18289319, a number not a person.

Because of this disconnect it is easy for people to say or do things on line that they would not do in real life. To make matters worse on line there is also a false sense of safety, as we type on our laptops under the blanket alone in our homes.

To reduce cyber bullying, Internet trolling, and stealing of copyrighted content we need to raise awareness that these are real issues that hurt real people. There also needs to be mechanisms for the victims to receive compensation for damages.

For example if David writes hateful messages on Peter's facebook wall, Peter should be able to sue for harassment and slander. Or if David downloaded art from Peter and then gave away or sold it, Peter should be able to sue for royalties and violating their intellectual property.

### Should only copyrights be enforced

I think convicting the average consumer would be difficult to enforce, and therefore difficult to implement. The focus should first be on businesses which are easier to hold accountable.

For example a former employer reused a copyrighted graphic on their home page. The owner of the content did a Google search for the filename and found it used on their website.

They sent a seize and desist mail along with a 10,000$ bill for the action. If the intern had known that the image was copy righted we would have selected a different one. Most likely the person figured that they would get away with it and no one would be able to enforce the copyright.
