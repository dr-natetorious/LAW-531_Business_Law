## What is the difference between laws and words

Laws are only words unless they are enforceable, which is a constraint of jurisdiction. Given this key constraint it is not only a key term but a core concept to business law.

For example say Alice feels she received an unfair deal from Bob. Alice cannot simply fly to Texas, where the laws are more favorable and then sue Bob for actions which took place in New York. Instead she needs to find a New York court that will hear the case and has the ability to make the ruling stick.

This same notion expends outside of Alice's arguments with Bob; it also limits what Alice is able to do without repercussions. Imagine that Alice wants to sell smart phones in Colorado. In order to do this in an ethical and sustainable manner; she needs to understand what federal, state, and county rules will be relevant to this effort.

If she fails to understand these requirements then her business model could experience unexpected interruptions. Which can result in third party investments or inefficient business expenses. All of which are only controllable by understanding jurisdiction.

## What is the difference between litigation and ADR

> Why do you think that a business would want to avoid having a judge decide a case in litigation? Would the business possibly lose some control of the resolution that way? Why might the business want the judge (or jury) to decide the case?

When a judge decided the outcome of a case, they have the ability to grant restitutions which would be much higher than the settlement amount. The defendant also runs the risk that an unknown is introduced into the process. From a risk management perspective it could be better to have a known expectation.

Also there could be concerns around evidence being collected and reported. Consider a high profile sexual harassment scandle that asks for all email communication. Those documents could hurt the businesses image or leak other sensitive details. To avoid these scenarios ADR can be used.

In other cases the business might prefer that a judge or jury hears the case. For example if they are able to play to the emotional side of the decider they have a could have more favorable odds.

Consider a prestigious charity that is being sued could leverage an angle that the plaintiff is taking money from that charities audience. This in term hurts the larger community.

Litigation is the process of resolving a dispute by discovering facts, going to trial, and coming to a conclusion by judge or jury. If the conclusions of the court are erroneous the process can extend to an appeals court or mistrial.

These steps are best suited for cases that are not clear cut or open to interpretation. For example in a automotive accident on an empty intersection, there is the potential for a "he said/she said" scenario. If neither side will admit fault then one party will sue the other party's insurance company for payment. If the amount is significant (e.g. due to injury), then the facts will need to be flushed out and a resolution reached by trial.

If one of the two parties is confident they will lose, they might seek an ADR, such as a settlement offer to short circuit the case. This will reduce the amount of work required on both sides.

Another benefit of private settlements is that they are not public record. Consider a scenario where UoPX was sued for negligence by one of their students. If it was publicly known that the plaintiff received 200,000$, other students would line up with similar suits expecting the same payment. Even each of the follow up cases was dismissed it would still generate large legal bills for the school.

## What are the advantatges of different legal structures

There are  different ways that we are able to create businesses and the inherit risk associated with each model.

Understanding the legal risks and rewards of these decisions, enables us to make smarter choices when we decide to create our own empires. Of the different options the limited liability corporation (LLC) sounds like the best option for most mid sized businesses. As an LLC we are able to grow capital and not worry about the bank repossessing our home due to failures of the business.

As the LLC becomes successful it can transition to a public corporation (PLC) and begin issuing stock to the public. This gives the business prestige and the ability to raise significantly more capital. Using that capital the business is able to make larger investments and continue the growth.

Though there are advantages to being a simple sole proprieter, such as its just simple. This would be a good option for a person that wants to be self employed and run a small business. They are true masters of their destiny with full control, but this control comes will full risk.
