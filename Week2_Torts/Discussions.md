## Criminal Law vs Civil Law

Criminal and civil law are similar in that they both prosecute an entity for causing damages against another entity; however in a criminal case the dependent might end up in jail instead of only having to pay monetary damages.

A criminal case could be the result of causing bodily harm to another person or intentionally using malicious dealing to take retirement funds from a group of people. Civil charges are more reserved for entity to entity disputes, such as contract disputes.

An example of a business facing criminal charges would be Enron, which willfully and intentionally misrepresented information resulting in the theft of billions of dollars. There was little dispute that their actions were accidental, or the damages limited.

To seek reprimands there was a class action lawsuit where the business was sued for the funds to be returned. In addition criminal charges were issued against the senior leadership as they were responsible for the actions of their staff.

## Torts and Levels

A civil wrong, called a tort, is an action which a reasonable person would object too. For example assault, slander, trespassing, and misuse of another persons property are all torts.

There are different degrees that a tort can be committed, which require different levels of punishment and reprimands. These can range from intent, reckless, negligent, or strict liability.

Intent means that the entity knew it was bad behavior, but did not care about the consequences. Reckless is when the person knew right from wrong, but did not use reasonable judgment. Negligent is when the person did not know that their behavior would result in damage. Finally strict liability is when it doesn't matter the reason the behavior happened the behavior happened.

For example consider Alice burns down Bobs house. This could have been due to:

- Leaving the stove on (negligent)
- Lighting fire works in the garage (reckless)
- Pouring gas over living room rug and setting it a blaze (intent)

## Micheal Jordon versus Jewel Grocery

Jewel grocery ran a full page advertisement congratulating Michael Jordon for making it into the basketball hall of fame. Jordon sued that the business did not have a right to use his image as a promotional to their store.

The court decreed that it was not commercial speech, as it did not ask customers to shop at Jewel nor did it ask that they purchase any specific item. Therefore it was protected as free speech.

I do not agree with the resolution as the statement was intended to promote the Jewel brand, and ride on the publicity of another entity. Though I understand the rational that it only infers and do not explicitly make the connection.

If they had instead said something along the lines of "Jordon is one of our favorite customers" then it directly connects Jordon's endorsement of their business, without his consent.  

This case also goes to show that if we are careful in our marketing campaigns, we can leverage other entities popularity without the need to pay them. While this may be slightly unethical behavior it would be completely legal behavior.

## Punitive versus Compensatory Damages

Compensatory damages are intended to pay for the loss due to the tort. Punitive damages are an attempt to further discourage the behavior by asking for additional rewards for the hassle.

Punitive damages are a reasonable request if the behavior is determined to be intentional. Compensatory would be more reasonable if they genuinely did not know of the issue.

In this case the hotel was aware of the issue and decided that they would play the odds, that being sued is less likely therefore less costly than being closed and having the exterminators clean up.

If they were to close that would be 600 rooms x 130$/day x 7 days + exterminator fees + post clean up fees + bad publicity. Given that the hotel was able to stay full and give a refund here or there to an angry customer, the utilitarian model would say do not fix the problem.

To push the cost benefit ratio into the favor of society, punitive damages were awarded so that the business will think twice before coming to the same conclusion next time. Instead of giving a refund to some customers they were asked to give 20,000 to all customers.

It also sends a message to other hotels in the area, that this is a serious issue.

## Negligence and Strict Liability

The point of tort laws are to seek repairs for damages from the responsible person. This forces people to use due diligence and not act in irrational or reckless manners. For example Alice crashed Bob's car, Alice should pay to have it restored.

While it is good to reactively punish civil wrongs, there needs to be a proactive mechanism to discourage the scenario happening in the first place. The proactive mechanisms come in the form of negligence and strict liability. They create the enforcement that a business which adds risk or does not correctly reduce risk should be penalized for their behavior.

Because there is a proactive element it changes the way that businesses are ran. The company needs to stretch their imagination and think of ways that people could become injured with their products. Designing from a safety first perspective results in safer and more ethical products.

## Tort Reform for Healthcare Lawsuits

It was interesting to hear what a huge impact tort laws have on medical costs. We recently took a step in the right direction with the Affordable Care Act. 

The goal of the act is to make medicines available to everyone, not only the rich. It also provides some protections to doctors, so they are less likely to be sued for malpractice. Without protecting the doctors, they will be less likely to help the as many sick people.

Though we need to not permit the doctors to recklessly perform operations which are not required. There needs to be accountability otherwise we run the risk of reducing the quality of care.

## See something say something

I liked the part where the presenter mentioned that even though there was a risk no one would point it out. Instead they sat back and laughed about it two months later.

This happens all the time at work, in part because we do not feel that people will listen to the feedback. They have a plan and they are smart so why do we need to derail that train? Though the challenge with this view is that it does not help anyone. 

The business has lost time and money, the planner has lost credibility, and the listener will have to listen to more meetings as they plan to redo that work. 

To get the feedback acknowledged it is often useful to ask the person in private. Then they are not pressured to defend their solution in front of the group. They can white board the idea out and come to the same conclusion.

## Alien Tort Claims Act

I didn't know that Coke was such a violent company, and even killed people who for not agreeing with them. 

It was also surprising to hear that a US court would be able to have jurisdiction on a case when the crime took place outside of the US. Though it seems that the ATA provides the federal government with the ability extend their reach if the company is based in America.

Laws such as this will cause issues in business especially as they expand through globalization. They will need to be careful that branch offices do not go crazy and start killing the staff. If they do the parent company would be liable. 

Combining this idea with last weeks content, there would be less risk to creating a separate LLC in the foreign country. Then it separates the responsibility and would allow the company to more safely avoid similar situations. 

Granted by having a corporate policy with zero tolerance for unethical behavior, ie. murdering employees, does not seem to unreasonable of a request.
