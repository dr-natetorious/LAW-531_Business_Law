## Security Regulations

Before the great depression there was little regulation of securities, which resulted in investors buying fraudulent assets. For example a corrupt individual could sell stocks in a fictional company and claim that the investors would get a good return. When the scam turned up to be fraudulent there was little the investor could do.

When situations such as this occur it reduces confidence in the market and hurts all businesses within that market. To protect both the legitimate businesses and the investor regulations such as the Security Act of 33 and 34 had to be passed. 

Under the Security Act of 33; it required that investors have a reasonable idea of what they were getting involved with. If the seller was misleading then the investor could see damages. To manage this system the SEC was formed

Under the Security Act of 34; it powers were extended to also require updates of the financial status of a business. It was no longer fair to say "we were once profitable" now they need to say "we still are profitable" and by how much.

### What is the impact of reduced invest confidence

The professional world of investing is not too different than when we were children on the play ground. Tommy comes over and asks for a quarter to buy chocolate milk at lunch, and promises to pay you back two quarters tomorrow. If Tommy owes everyone else in class that same quarter its unlikely that we want to invest. Comparatively if he has good credit and merely forgot his lunch money we invest. 

The same thing occurs during securities investing, is the investment is likely to pan out in our favor we'll make the investment provided we can afford too. If we see the investment as risky then we prefer to hold our money for a better opportunity instead of watching our hard earned money disappear unused.

### Do foreign countries have different regulations

Other countries have different securities regulations and different requirements all together.

For example the SOX act exists to protect investors in American businesses. If an investor buys stock in a Chinese company the protections and oversight provided by SOX would not apply. The investor would instead need to rely on foreign nation to perform due diligence and oversight. How probable that is to happen would depend on where the market is located and what the market even was.

At the same time care needs to be taken that the foreign markets rules do not catch investors off guard. For instance a common investment tactic is to 'short sell' a security. In a short sell the person sells the stock now and agrees to buy it in the future, betting that at that point it will be cheaper.

In some countries such as Taiwan there is a limit as to how much a stock is allowed to fall within a trading window. If the person short selling was unaware of this rule they could severely limited in their potential profit.

## Congressional Review Act

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); is the department of the executive branch which is responsible for coming up with protections for land, sea, and air. To enact these protections introduces some challenges for businesses as they need to comply with the regulations.

For example in the chapter, they described new requirements for stationary facilities which produced more than 100 tons of emissions per year. One of the businesses which was impacted by this, due to producing 250 tons per year, sued that the rules were unjust. This seems reasonable as the agency has created a hardship for the business. 

As more regulations are this also runs the risk that these same businesses will simply move to more favorable foreign countries. Consider a manufacturing plant, they would need to pay more to ship their finished product back into America but could offset those costs by paying third world employees smaller wages. Meanwhile the American employees are now out of a job and the only ones that are hurt. 

Another risk comes with carbon emission credits, which are effectively the right to pollute. Businesses which have more profitable margins can simply buy the credits on the open market as a security a legally side step the rules.

## Freedom of Information Act

The first time that I heard about the FOIA was in a Reproducible Research class, which focused on investigating published statistics and statements then either confirming or disproving the results. 

For many of the case studies the professor described how they would ask the researchers or businesses to release their data sets. In all the examples the requests were denied and the information not shared. To get around this the professor leveraged FOIA requests for the government to release their copy. 

He said that if the business used public money to in part fund the research then the government is typically required to have a copy; which is can be requested. 

This raises an interesting question as future business leaders working on "our next big product." If we accept governmental money then it is possible that we are also making our hard work open for the public and our competitors.

## Anti-Bribery

Entities attempt to bribe foreign officials with the hopes that they will get special treatment. For example they pay <X> 50,000$ and then win a bid for a 10 million dollar project. Bribery of foreign officials is not only unethical and in many situations illegal. 

This makes sense as it goes against the guiding principals that have repeatably been discussed throughout this business law course. Everyone needs to be fairly judged and treated on their merits. When people cheat the system it is a social wrong, and goes against the business code that the rest of society believes that one should follow. 

Whenever a business commits a tort, society views it as though damages have occurred and restitutions need paid. Depending on how heinous the act, punitive damages also contributed. For example if ABC Co, has been accused numerous times of violating the FCPA and the fines are not stopping them; then the amount due needs to be increased until they learn and stop.

## Future of Global Economy: Meeting of the Minds: The Global Debt Crisis

The entire video was very interesting as Bill Clinton expressed his concerns on a wide range of issues. Some of his earlier points reflected on gender discrimination and how it is critical to get more women into science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). 

Then Bill went on to talk about the unemployment rate during his terms and afterward. He commented that he was lucky that information technology had taken off during that period and resulted in generating 35% more jobs. In todays world we need another new job market that will have an equal impact. To accomplish this his money is on clean renewable energy. 

Bill then went on to discuss how we need to make the banks and big business feel comfortable to invest and loan out their money. In 2010, there was 3 trillion dollars sitting in cash reserves of which could be safely lent at a 10:1 ratio and stimulate the economy in significant ways.

### Should they bail out everyone

While it doesn't make sense to bail out every company, it does make sense to bail out some of the companies. If we do not then there is a risk of the domino effect.

For example ABC is a multi billion dollar enterprise. Meanwhile DEF own billions of dollars in preferred stock in ABC. OPQ is a lending firm loaning money at 10:1 ratio, and holds 25% of their assets in DEF and JKL.

If ABC collapses, that effectively means DEF's investment is worthless and they are out that investment and their market cap is dropped by an equal amount (more if margin accounts are involved).

OPQ's assets are also decreased and they are no longer responsibly lending at 10:1, instead they are lending at 20:1. They become over vested and need 'to call' the loans to compensate. Now a serge of other businesses who were also over vested have to come up with money they don't have and thus default and go into foreclosure.

### What caused the credit crisis

A core challenge to borrowing money is that one needs to first prove they do not need the funds. When that is not the case the loan introduces risk to the business which is irresponsible and violates the trust of the share holders.

The mortgage crisis is a great example of this, banks were giving out housing loans to people that had no ability to pay the debt. This resulted in compounded debt which eventually lead to default. Since that mortgage had been rolled into a security and sold on the open market it caused a cascade of damages.

As an investor, I would be in the same camp as these businesses and would hold my money as cash until confidence in the market increased.

Which raises the question how do we raise confidence in the market? My humble opinion is regulations on securities markets. Limit the amount of negative behavior that can take place (e.g. over extending margins), and provide stimulus to prevent default.
